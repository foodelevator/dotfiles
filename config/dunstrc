    #             ones, open the context menu.
    # * close_current: Close current notification.
    # * close_all: Close all notifications.

# GLib based applications export their desktop-entry name. In comparison to the appname,
# the desktop-entry won't get localized.

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
